# Prerequisites for Running
    For the official version, you will have your own SDK AppID.
    For the demo version, you can use the built-in AppID.

# Getting Started
    Clone the repository code.
    Replace the Aopa AppID.
# Important Notes:
    The appSign is a key assigned by Aopa Cloud to your project and should not be disclosed.
    For formal development, the logic for token generation must be implemented on the business backend, and the SDK will obtain the token through the business server. For more details, see the Aopa Cloud Audio and Video        SDK Developer Center.
