/** Defines a set of protocols to implement the custom video source and pass it to the underlying media engine to replace the default video source.

 BBRtcVideoSourceProtocol allows you to take the ownership of the video source and manipulate it.
 By default, when enabling real-time communications, the BBRtc SDK enables the default video input device (built-in camera) to start video streaming.
 By calling [setVideoSource]([BBRtcEngineKit setVideoSource:]), you can change the default video input device, control it, and send the video source from the specified input device to the BBRtc Media Engine to handle the remaining video processes; such as video filtering and publishing the video to the RTC connection.
 Once you have implemented this interface, the BBRtc Media Engine automatically releases the ownership of the current video input device and passes the ownership to you, so that you can use the same video input device to capture the video stream.
 BBRtcVideoSourceProtocol consists of the following methods:

 * Initializes the Video Source ([shouldInitialize](shouldInitialize))
 * Enables the Video Source ([shouldStart](shouldStart))
 * Disables the Video Source ([shouldStop](shouldStop))
 * Releases the Video Source ([shouldDispose](shouldDispose))
 * Retrieves the Buffer Type ([bufferType](bufferType))

 Note:

 * All methods in [BBRtcVideoSourceProtocol]([BBRtcVideoSourceProtocol]) are callbacks. The media engine maintains a finite state machine and uses these methods at the right time. Do not use these methods directly in the app.
 * These methods are synchronized.
 * If the media engine restarts during the process, these methods can be repeated for a couple of times.
 * These methods are not in the primary thread.

 When using the BBRtcVideoSourceProtocol, call BBRtcVideoBufferType, BBRtcVideoPixelFormat, and BBRtcVideoRotation to set the buffer type, pixel format, and rotation angle of the transmitted video.

 When the video source is initialized, the media engine initializes the BBRtcVideoFrameConsumer pointer in BBRtcVideoSourceProtocol, then the video source sends the video frame to the media engine through the BBRtcVideoFrameConsumer method.

/** Defines a set of protocols to implement the custom video sink and pass it to the underlying media engine to replace the default video sink.

 BBRtcVideoSinkProtocol allows you to implement the custom video source.
 By default, when you try to enable real-time communications, the BBRtc SDK enables the default video sink to start video rendering. By calling [setLocalVideoRenderer]([BBRtcEngineKit setLocalVideoRenderer:]) and [setRemoteVideoRenderer]([BBRtcEngineKit setRemoteVideoRenderer:forUserId:]), you can change the default video sink.
 Once you implement this interface, you receive callbacks from the media engine to indicate the state of the custom video sink, the underlying media engine, and enable their synchronization. Follow each callback to handle the resource allocation, and to release and receive the video frame from the media engine.
 BBRtcVideoSinkProtocol defines a set of protocols to create a customized video sink. The BBRtcVideoFrameConsumer interface passes the video frames to the media engine, which then passes them to the renderer.
 After a customized video sink is created, the app passes it to the media engine, see [setLocalVideoRenderer]([BBRtcEngineKit setLocalVideoRenderer:]) and [setRemoteVideoRenderer]([BBRtcEngineKit setRemoteVideoRenderer:forUserId:]).
 BBRtcVideoSinkProtocol consists of the following methods:

 * Initializes the Video Sink ([shouldInitialize](shouldInitialize))
 * Enables the Video Sink ([shouldStart](shouldStart))
 * Disables the Video Sink ([shouldStop](shouldStop))
 * Releases the Video Sink ([shouldDispose](shouldDispose))
 * Retrieves the Buffer Type ([bufferType](bufferType))
 * Retrieves the Pixel Format ([pixelFormat](pixelFormat))
 * (Optional) Outputs the Video in the Pixel Buffer ([renderPixelBuffer](renderPixelBuffer:rotation:))
 * (Optional) Outputs the Video in the Raw Data ([renderRawData](renderRawData:size:rotation:))

 Note: All methods defined in BBRtcVideoSinkProtocol are callbacks. The media engine uses these methods to inform the customized renderer of its internal changes.
 An example is shown in the following steps to customize the video sink:

 1. Call bufferType and BBRtcVideoPixelFormat to set the buffer type and pixel format of the video frame.
 2. Implement [shouldInitialize](shouldInitialize), [shouldStart](shouldStart), [shouldStop](shouldStop), and [shouldDispose](shouldDispose) to manage the customized video sink.
 3. Implement the buffer type and pixel format as specified in BBRtcVideoFrameConsumer.
 4. Create the customized video sink object.
 5. Call the [setLocalVideoRenderer]([BBRtcEngineKit setLocalVideoRenderer:]) and [setRemoteVideoRenderer]([BBRtcEngineKit setRemoteVideoRenderer:forUserId:]) methods to set the local and remote renderers.
 6. The media engine calls functions in BBRtcVideoSinkProtocol according to its internal state.
