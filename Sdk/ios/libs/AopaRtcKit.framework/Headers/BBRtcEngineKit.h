 *
 * Starting from version 1.1, the SDK has transitioned from block callbacks to delegate callbacks for improved reliability.
 * While block callbacks are still operational and included in the current release, they are considered deprecated.
 * BBRtc advises migrating to delegate callbacks for all callback functionality.

 * - To activate voice activity detection for the local user, make sure to set `report_vad(YES)` in the `enableAudioVolumeIndication` method.
 * - The `muteLocalAudioStream` method influences the callback behavior:
 *   - If the local user mutes their stream, the callback for the local user is halted immediately.

 * @param frameRate The frame rate of the video, which can be set to values such as 5, 10, 15, 24, or 30 fps. The maximum supported frame rate is 30 fps.
 * @param bitrate The bitrate of the video, which needs to be calculated based on the width, height, and frame rate. For detailed guidance, refer to the bitrate table in `BBRtcVideoEncoderConfiguration`. The bitrate adjustments for different frame rates are as follows:
 *   - At 5 fps, use half of the recommended bitrate.
 *   - At 15 fps, use the recommended bitrate.
 *   - At 30 fps, use 1.5 times the recommended bitrate.
 *   Adjust the bitrate proportionally for other frame rates.
 *
 * **Example**: For a resolution of 320x240 with a frame rate of 15 fps, the bitrate would be 200. Adjust the bitrate as follows for different frame rates:
 *   - At 5 fps, the bitrate would be 100.
 *   - At 30 fps, the bitrate would be 300.
 *
 * If a bitrate is set beyond the appropriate range, the SDK will automatically adjust it to a value within the acceptable range.
